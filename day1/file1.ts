// TS is Staticly typed language, which means we need to specify the type of variable when we declare it.

/*
let ann = 10 // here we are declaring a variable 'a' and assigning it the value of 10. TS will infer the type of 'a' as number.
ann = 20 // we can reassign the value of 'a' to 20, but we cannot assign a value of a different type, like a string or boolean.
ann = "Hello" // this will give an error because 'a' is of type number and we are trying to assign a string to it.
console.log(ann);  // It will pritn "Hello" in the console.

// It happens because we have used "node day3/file1.ts" to run the file.

let bann: number = 10 // here we are declaring a variable 'b' and specifying its type as number. We are also assigning it the value of 10.
bann  = "Hello" // this will give an error because 'b' is of type number and we are trying to assign a string to it.
console.log(bann); // It will throw an error because node cannot run a file with
//  strict assignment as here we did variable to as "number"
